# Coder exchange

One task at a time. **The highest-numbered directory is the active one.**

```
coder/
├── README.md          ← this file (protocol; rarely changes)
└── NNN-short-name/
    ├── TASK.md        ← thinker → coder.  The work order. Coder does not edit.
    └── REPORT.md      ← coder → thinker.  Coder fills in the template. Thinker does not edit.
```

## Rules

1. **Two files per task. No more.** Analysis, measurements, and rationale go *inside* `REPORT.md`,
   not into new files. If something genuinely deserves its own document, `REPORT.md` says so and the
   thinker creates it under `ai-documents/` — not here.
2. **`TASK.md` is append-only after the coder starts.** If the work order changes mid-task, the
   thinker appends a dated `## Amendment` section rather than rewriting. The coder must be able to
   see what the instructions said when the work began.
3. **`REPORT.md` is the coder's only channel.** Write it as you go, not at the end. A task that stops
   early still gets a report saying where it stopped and why.
4. **Never delete a closed task directory.** It is the record of what was asked and what came back.
5. Big logs stay in `sw/verilator_logs/` (gitignored). `REPORT.md` cites paths, never pastes dumps.

## Task lifecycle

- **Open** — `TASK.md` exists, `REPORT.md` is the untouched template.
- **In progress** — coder is editing `REPORT.md`.
- **Closed** — `REPORT.md` has a filled-in verdict. The thinker opens the next numbered directory.

| # | Task | Status |
|---|---|---|
| 001 | Phase 3 — close the reuse loop (pin → search → serve → teardown) | **closed** (2026-08-28) — commits 1-3 landed; commit 4 handed to 002 |
| 002 | Fix the partner-set latch, then land commit 4 | **open** (2026-08-28) |
